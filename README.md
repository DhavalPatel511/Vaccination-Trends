Patient Vaccination Trends Analysis

Project Summary:

This project focuses on analyzing patient vaccination trends, specifically flu shots in the year 2022. Leveraging advanced SQL queries, we extracted crucial information from diverse tables to ensure data integrity and accuracy in the retrieval process. The extracted data was then transformed into a dynamic Tableau dashboard, presenting insightful visualizations that shed light on various aspects of patient demographics and vaccination trends.

Key Achievements:

SQL Expertise: Executed complex SQL queries to extract pertinent information on patients who received flu shots, ensuring precision and reliability in data retrieval.
Tableau Visualization: Transformed SQL-extracted data into a visually compelling Tableau dashboard. The dashboard includes bar graphs illustrating patients of different races and age groups, a geographical map showcasing patient distribution across counties, and an area graph tracking the running total of individuals who received the flu shot.

Comprehensive Overview: Developed a dynamic Tableau table displaying a detailed breakdown of patients who opted for the flu shot and those who did not, providing a comprehensive overview of vaccination trends.

Performance Metrics: Implemented performance metrics through two scoreboards, highlighting the total number of patients and the count of individuals who successfully received the flu shot. This emphasizes the project's impact on public health.
